## Data Analysis and Dashboard Design

In this section of the project, we focus on data analysis and dashboard design. Here, we first examine the extracted data and then design and implement a dashboard using appropriate libraries and tools, enabling users to view and analyze the data.

### Part 1: Analytical Charts
In this section, you should place the requested charts in your dashboard. These charts are purely for analytical purposes.

- Display the number of books per tag (note that each book can have more than one tag).
- Display the top 10 publishers based on the number of books.
- Display the number of books per publication year.
- Display the top 10 authors based on the number of books.
- Display the number of books per translator for the top 10 translators.
- Scatter plot to show the relationship between the number of pages and the publication year of books.
- Scatter plot to show the relationship between the undiscounted prices of books and their publication years.
- Scatter plot of prices based on book ratings.
- Display the number of books based on their binding type.

### Part 2: Interactive Charts (Advanced Search)
In this section of the dashboard, we implement a search panel that allows users to search and filter books based on various book features. Using this panel, users can search based on book title, author, publisher, publication year, and more. Users can find their desired books and view the results in the form of a table or charts.

In fact, you will design a user interface for advanced searching in your book database. Users can select their desired features in this panel and find their desired books, viewing the results in a table or charts.

For this section, you should consider at least 5 book features and provide filtering capabilities for them. If you implement more than 5 features, extra points will be awarded up to a specified maximum.

### Part 3: Further Analysis
In this section, based on the extracted data, you will add at least three analyses (in the form of charts) according to your interpretation of the available data. These additional analyses will help users better identify and examine the existing data.

**Note:**
- The dashboard design should be done using the Streamlit Python library.
- The data must be loaded into the dashboard directly from your database, and using auxiliary files will result in point deduction.
- Creativity and innovative chart designs will be welcomed and awarded extra points.
- Recommendation: In the future, after learning Power BI, you can create compelling and attractive dashboards by connecting this tool to your database, designing engaging charts for analyzing your book database.
