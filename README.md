# Quora Data Analysis Bootcamp Project

Welcome to the Quora Data Analysis Bootcamp Project repository! This project aims to extract, analyze, and visualize data related to books from the  [iranketab](https://www.iranketab.ir/) website. It involves a comprehensive approach, including data extraction, database design, dashboard creation, and statistical analysis.

## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to build a book bank by extracting and analyzing information about books available on the iranketab website. The project is structured into several phases, including:

1. **Data Extraction:** Extracting and cleaning information from the iranketab website, covering various book attributes such as title, author, price, and more.

2. **Database Design:** Designing a well-structured database to store the extracted information, ensuring optimal normalization and relationships between tables.
